excerpt: 'Online Social Networks as new phenomenon have affected our life in many positive ways; however it can be considered as way of malicious activities. Identifying anomalous users has become a challenge and many researches are conducted but they are not enough and in this paper we propose a methodology based on graph metrics of online social networks. The experimental results illustrate that majority of friends in online social networks have common friends with their friends while anomalous users may not follow this fact.'
