excerpt: 'Vehicular computing plays a critical role in modern transportation, enabling real-time data collection and communication for improved mobility, traffic management, and safety. However, privacy concerns arise due to the transmission of sensitive vehicular and environmental data. For example, roadside cameras recording driving violations, safety and traffic surveillance etc. Data transmission in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has increased in recent years. This is due to the growing number of new IoT devices in the field. However, data privacy has become a concern, as users' data may be at risk. Roadside cameras are often used for purposes such as detecting violations or assessing safety. Many studies have looked at how to protect the privacy of the data collected by these cameras. This paper introduces RL-MoE, a privacy-preserving framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to process vehicular data efficiently while safeguarding privacy. The proposed approach extracts textual descriptions from roadside camera images, reducing the need for raw image transmission and mitigating privacy risks. The MoE framework employs multiple specialized experts to generate textual summaries based on structured prompts, while an RL-based optimization model refines the text for accuracy and relevance. Explainability techniques are incorporated to enhance the transparency and reliability of the generated outputs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RL-MoE significantly reduces privacy risks while maintaining high-quality data for traffic analysis. The results indicate that the approach enhances privacy protection by limiting unnecessary data exposure, optimizes data transmission efficiency, and ensures compliance with privacy regulations. This study highlights the potential of AI-driven techniques in achieving a balance between effective vehicular monitoring and privacy preservation in intelligent transportation systems.'
