excerpt: 'Vehicular computing is vital to modern transportation, enabling real-time data collection for improved traffic flow, mobility, and safety. However, the widespread use of roadside cameras and IoT devices raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive vehicular and environmental data are often transmitted. To address these issues, this paper introduces RL-MoE, a privacy-preserving framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. Instead of transmitting raw images, RL-MoE extracts textual descriptions from camera feeds, significantly reducing privacy risks. The MoE component uses specialized experts to generate summaries based on structured prompts, while the RL module optimizes these descriptions for accuracy and relevance. The framework also includes explainability methods to ensure transparency and trust. Experimental results show that RL-MoE effectively protects user privacy, enhances data transmission efficiency, and supports compliance with privacy standards. This study demonstrates how AI techniques can balance effective traffic monitoring with robust privacy safeguards in Intelligent Transportation Systems.'
